## Project Description
We acknowledge and are grateful for the replication materials provided by the authors of Soubhik Barari, Christopher Lucas and Kevin Munger. 
This project replicates the paper: Political Deepfake Videos Misinform the Public, But No More than Other Fake Media written by Soubhik Barari, Christopher Lucas, and Kevin Munger. We compare the outcomes of two survey experiments across different age groups. We want to examine how young people response to different fake clippings, especially for the deepfake videos. All data analysis are performed using R and the following packages are used: `tidyverse`, `ggplot2`, `survey`, `stargazer`,`weights`,`optparse`,`broom`,`cowplot`,`AMR`.
